Windows 11, as well as several recent versions of Win10, make use of WSL 2: this is the second redesigned version of WSL1 that runs a full Linux kernel in a Hyper-V hypervisor for better compatibility.  When you enable this feature Windows 11 downloads a Linux kernel created by Microsoft that runs in the background, while, Windows Update keeps the kernel up-to-date.  \n","Eventually, you can also use your own custom Linux kernel. \n","\n","## Installation process.\n","\n","### Activation via command line. \n","\n","1.   Open the windows terminal or command prompt (cmd) **as administrator** (right-click on the taskbar start button)\n","2.  Type at the prompt ` wsl -install ` to enable the windows subsystem for linux.  \n","\n","      2.2. Having completed this step those with a windows 10 system, but also on windows 11 following a different installation method from the command line, you need to type in the search bar \"*optionalfeatures*\" which will take you to the \"*Windows Features*\" screen where the following should be checked:\n","\n","\n","\n","  * Virtual Machine Platform\n","  * Windows Hyper-V platform.\n","  * Windows subsystem for Linux.\n","\n","  After this step press OK and restart the computer\n","\n","\n","3.  After the installation of wsl is complete, you need to restart the computer \n","\n","4. Upon restarting the computer you can run the command ` wsl -l -v ` to find out what Linux distrubutions are already installed (You may have automatically installed the latest version of Ubuntu, as happened in our case, alternatively if there are no distributions already installed or if you prefer to install different ones see the following points)\n","\n","5. To view all available distributions run the command `` wsl -l -o `` \n","\n","6. To install a new distribution run the command ` wsl -install -d NAME `, where NAME should be replaced with one of the distrubutions of your choice that appear as indicated in the previous point under the NAME column \n","\n","7. You can install a variety of distributions, and afterwards you must reboot the computer. Once restarted you can start the distribution directly from the windows start menu\n","\n","\n","### Enable WSL alternatively.\n","You can also enable the Windows subsystem for Linux through the operating system interface, without using the command line. The steps to be performed in this case are:\n","\n","1. See section 2.2 of the previous method \n","2. Install the desired Linux distribution by downloading it directly from the Microsoft Store. Install it as you would any other application. Once the installation is finished, you can start it via the windows Start menu  \n","\n","\n","## Linux programs with a graphical user interface.\n","One of the main advantages of the WSL subsystem for windows 11 is precisely that it can natively run Linux programs with a graphical interface (which is not possible with WSL for windows 10, except by also installing a graphical server). To do this one must:\n","\n","1. Boot the Linux distribution we chose earlier (If this is the first boot, a user name and password will be required)\n","\n","2. Make sure you have the latest version of the distribution and possibly upgrade it via the command `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`\n","\n","3. Now you can then install any Linux program with a GUI via the command `sudo apt install NAME -y`, where NAME should be replaced with the name of the desired program. Some of the most common and widely used are: gimp (digital image processing software); gedit (text editor); nautilus (file management software).\n","4. Once installed simply type the name of the program into the Linux window and its window will open (Note that the terminal may show warning (Warning) messages or actual errors (Error): this is all completely normal and does not indicate a malfunction). \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"kuntNwZpAGpJ"}}]}
