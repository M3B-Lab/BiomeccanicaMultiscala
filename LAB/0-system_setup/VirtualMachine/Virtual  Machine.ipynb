In particular we focus on modeling atomistic scale samples and studying them.\n","\n","We have focused our attention on the use of **software for multiscale modeling**; more specifically, we have had the opportunity to see how the tools provided by computer science allow us to implement processes that would take a long time to obtain fundamental information for biological research.\n","\n","We learned how to use **Linux**, as well as the **Bash and Python languages**.\n","\n","The final goal was the writing of the following tutorial, in which the processes that led to the knowledge of these modern software and languages for modeling multiscale samples are folded step by step.\n","\n","The following tutorial provides an initial section to assist you during the **installation** of **Linux** on your computer. The ultimate goal is to get you to display a Linux terminal on your screen.\n","The next chapter introduces the **Bash language**, including the basic commands and the most commonly used programming structures. This is followed by a chapter on making **Bash scripts**. \n","The last section is devoted to the use of the **Python language** and, in particular, its modules dedicated to graphical representation. \n","\n","A common thread throughout the tutorial will be the **analysis** and **modeling of proteins**. The use of the Bash language is aimed, in fact, at the analysis of .pdb files and that of Python at the graphical representation and modeling of the protein whose data are collected in the analyzed pdb file\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"S8WJptwvKLWH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **LINUX INSTALLATION**\n","****\n","Regarding the installation of Linux on one's own pc, several paths can be followed.\n","The first option is to install Linux as the only operating system. This is a radical solution; all data saved on the pc will be lost.\n","In case you do not want to change the operating system, you can follow one of the following paths:\n","\n","1) installation of a **virtual machine**\n","\n","2) installation of a **subsystem on pc with **Windows 10** system (WSL10)\n","\n","3) installation of a **subsystem** on pc with **Windows 11** system (WSL11)\n","\n","In the following sections you can find step-by-step instructions to follow for each of these three options"],"metadata":{"id":"LeRZF0AUWVcK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","**ASSISTANCE IN INSTALLING LINUX ON WINDOWS SYSTEM VIA VIRTUAL MACHINE**\n","****\n","For detailed procedures follow the guide provided. Below we provide a brief summary of the necessary steps accompanied by some useful tips and links to solve any problems encountered during the installation process.\n","\n","1.   Download virtualbox from the link : www.virtualbox.org \n","2.   Download the .exe file and proceed by clicking on 'next' without changing the basic settings \n","3.   Download the .ova file at the link https://drive.google.com/file1-CLJIgcSw2BByQQNs1in326oyij2ofvz/view?usp=sharing\n","\n","Tips:\n","* If you have difficulty downloading the file on the first attempt, try again several times until the goal is achieved. In fact, it is possible that you may have to repeat the procedure several times if the download starts but stops after a few minutes, signaling an error. It is recommended that you make at least 3-4 attempts.. \n","* **Warning** : to start the download, do not press on the bar where 'zipper extractor' appears. , but press on the download icon in the upper right corner\n","4.   Open the VirtualMachine and follow the instructions to import the file. \n","     Tip : change, if necessary, the CPU and RAM parameters, it is recommended to enter respectively (**CPU : 2 / RAM : 2048 MB**). These parameters can also be changed later. \n","\n","5.   Click on import (the file may take about ten minutes to load).\n","\n","* **WARNING**: If the icon described in the help in the upper left corner of the virtualbox does not appear, or if the session ended warning appears, use the instructions for virtualizing the VM , specified at the following the link: https://www.aranzulla.it/come-attivare-la-virtualizzazione-nel-bios-1231556.html#:~:text=Ad%20every%20mode%2C%20every%20there%C3%B2,the%20Enable%2FActive%20option.\n","\n","\n","OTHER PROCEDURES \n","*It is possible that once opened, the VM screen appears blurry and enlarged, you need to fix the scale and resolution settings as described in the guide (if you do not see the menu indicated in the guide , go to **Settings > Screen > Scale Factor > 100%**)\n","\n","* Activating the **Virtualization of the BIOS** (Caution: the procedure to be followed may vary slightly from pc to pc).\n","Press the **win+I** keys > select **edit pc settings** > **update and restore** > **restore** > **restart now** > **troubleshooting** > **advanced options** > **UFI firmware settings** > reboot > press the **f10** key > select **system configuration** (top) > **virtualization technology** > **enable**.\n","\n","\n","* For guest addition , in case the guide procedure does not work, follow the instructions below. \n","Go to google and type **Oracle > download > VM virtualbox > Vbox guest addition**.\n","Then go back to virtualBox , go to settings , go to storage , select 'VBoxGuestAddition.iso'. Select the diskette next to 'optical drive'. Select the item ' choose a disk file...' and import the Vbox guest addition download.\n","* In conclusion go to **Devices > insert guest addition CD image > press 'ok' > press 'run' > enter password 'student'** , if required. Finally press 'enter' when prompted by the terminal."],"metadata":{"id":"MoNkSAG_YTrC"}}]}
