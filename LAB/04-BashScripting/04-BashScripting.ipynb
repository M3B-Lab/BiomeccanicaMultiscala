    "There is one thing you should remember, which is essential especially if you start to write more and more complex scripts. Generally speaking a <b><u>computer program</b></u> is a set of instructions the CPU should execute, and is stored on the hard disk. When you launch a program, these instructions are copied into the memory (RAM), and the copied program is now called a <b><u>process</b></u>. The important point here is that you can have multiple processes of the same program (e.g. open two windows of the same program, or launch the same command in two terminal windows). When you open a terminal window, a bash **process** is started, giving you the interactive bash intepreter where you can type commands. If you then launch a script, a <u>different bash process will be started</u> just for the script, within the bash process that was started with your terminal. This is a detail, but has actual consequences on things such as sharing variables and so on."
