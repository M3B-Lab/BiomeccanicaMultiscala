In particular we focus on modeling atomistic scale samples and studying them.\n","\n","We have focused our attention on the use of **software for multiscale modeling**; more specifically, we have had the opportunity to see how the tools provided by computer science allow us to implement processes that would take a long time to obtain fundamental information for biological research.\n","\n","We learned how to use **Linux**, as well as the **Bash** and **Python languages**. \n","\n","The final goal was the writing of the following tutorial, in which the processes that led to the knowledge of these modern software and languages for modeling multiscale samples are folded step by step.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-FRbXlkJu1VK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**ASSISTANCE IN INSTALLING LINUX ON WINDOWS SYSTEM VIA VIRTUAL MACHINE**\n","\n","For detailed procedures follow the guide provided.

Open the VirtualMachine and follow the instructions to import the file. \n","     Tip : change, if necessary, the CPU and RAM parameters, it is recommended to enter respectively (**CPU : 2 / RAM : 2048 MB**).
