    "## Molecule: Cell-Penetrating Peptide\n",
    "\n",
    "The discovery of Cell-Penetrating Peptides (CPPs) represents an important breakthrough for the delivery of large cargo molecules or nanoparticles for several clinical applications. A main feature of CPPs is the ability to\n",
    "penetrate the cell membrane at low micromolar concentrations in vivo and in vitro, without binding any chiralreceptors and without causing significant membrane damage. This ability offers significant therapeutic potential,\n",
    "as targeting areas normally difficult to access for drugs.\n",
    "TAT peptide and Drosophila Antennapedia homeodomain-derived penetratin peptide (pAntp) are the most\n",
    "extensively studied CPPs. In particular, the pAntp is a 16-residues long cationic peptide derived from the third\n",
    "helix of the homeodomain of the Drosohila transcription factor Antennapedia. This amphipatic CPP, largely\n",
    "unstructured in solution, is positively charged at neutral pH (since it contains four lysine and three arginine\n",
    "residues). Interestingly, the pAntp is able to cross biological membranes and enter a hydrophobic environment\n",
    "upon interaction with negatively-charged molecules, like phosphatic acid (PA) or phosphatidylserine (PS).\n",
    "However, mechanisms by which pAntp comes into the cells have not been completely understood. Proposed\n",
    "mechanisms of pAntp cellular uptake hypothesize direct crossing of the peptide through the membrane at low\n",
    "peptide concentrations (1μM) and an endocytotic pathway at high concentrations (10μM). Several studies have\n",
    "suggested that pAntp amphiphilicity may not be enough to drive the membrane penetration, indicating instead\n",
    "tryptophan as key player. Replacement of thryptophan by phenylanine resulted in a loss of penetration activity\n",
    "when interacting with membranes and bicelles. Moreover, a recent computational work has characterized the\n",
    "binding mode of pAntp-DPPC bilayers, proposing arginine, lysine and tryptophan as driving the penetration\n",
    "mechanism.\n",
    "This extraordinary ability of CPPs to penetrate cell membranes has brought to designate them as perfect\n",
    "functionalization molecules for drug delivery systems.\n",
    "For example, pAntp might be employed to decorate Magnetic Nanoparticles (MNPs), thus combining their\n",
    "fascinating physico-chemical properties with a cell-penetrating ability to design novel effective therapeutic\n",
    "strategies as well as innovative biotechnology methodologies. Size, biocompatibility and excellent magnetic\n",
    "properties, have made MAG and Silica-coated MAG the object of a remarkable amount of research in the last\n",
    "decade and numerous biomedical applications have been reported. Recently, MNPs combined with magnetic\n",
    "fields were used to enable cell positioning under non-permissive conditions, local gene therapy and/or\n",
    "optimization of MNP- assisted lentiviral gene transfer.\n",
    "Functionalization strategies comprise grafting with organic molecules, including small organic biomolecules such\n",
    "as CPPs, and/or coating with an inorganic layer (e.g., silica).\n",
    "Design and properties prediction of functionalization strategies may be addressed by computational molecular\n",
    "modelling. In this context, Kubiak-Ossowska and coworkers have recently employed computational modelling\n",
    "to investigate the adsorption of TAT peptides onto three silica surface models. This work has suggested that TAT-\n",
    "Silica adsorption mechanism is driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions mainly involving arginine\n",
    "residues and the nanoparticle surface."
