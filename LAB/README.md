# Overview

These are the LABs delivered during the Biomeccanica Multiscala course in the form of Colab/Jupyter notebooks. 

To run these LABs students can: 

1) Run all notebook from Colab

2) Run all notebooks locally from their machines.

If students choose option (2), they have to set their machine accordingly (see *LAB 0 - System Setup* and *INSTALL.md*)

### LAB 0 - System Setup

This LAB will not be held during scheduling lessons, but contains some additional materials that students can use to install a Linux virtualization on their local machines in order to easily run notebooks. 

File ***INSTALL.md*** cointains the requirements for the python environment to run the notebooks

### LAB 1 - Introduction to Colab and Python 

In this LAB, we will understand what is a notebook and how to use it into a Google Colab environment or from a jupyter notebook. This LAB contains also an introduction to the python language which will be used sometimes during the course

### LAB 2 - Probability

During this LAB we will perform some exercises on probabilities in a notebook environment using python. The topics covered by this LAB are related to the first part of the ***Molecular Driving Forces*** lecture, held by prof. Marco Deriu during the theoretical lessons.
